# Getting started

## Install R 

R can be downloaded from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/)

After the installation, you can use R on the command line by typing R but it's a bit dry as you can see.

## Install  RStudio

the best way to use R is to use a development environment and the most widely used is RStudio. All the examples in this book will be using it.

[Here the webpage to download it](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

After this installation, you are ready to go üôå

before starting running some R code, I would suggest reading [this small explanation](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/the-four-rstudio-windows.html) about the RStudio interface.

For your culture, you should know that it is also possible to [execute code online.](ressources/execute-r-code-online.md)
