### Why using R for SEO?

R is a programming language specialized in data mining, statistical and data analysis and data visualization. It also have a very decent capacity for crawling. Basically, everything that useful for SEO.

When you have understood the fundamentals, R' is also quite easy to read and write. With 3 lines of codes, you can crawl a website or extract some Google Analytics data and a CSV with it.

### When should you be using R for SEO?

R become useful when you start to deal with big websites with thousands of pages. I'm a big fan of automation but the relevance needs to be properly evaluated. 

There are also a lot of great SEO tools out there, R will never replace them but it's a very nice free addition to your set of tools.

### So... Why not Python?

Python is an extraordinary programing language, very versatile, in many cases faster. If you know how to use it, it seems to be better than R 90% of the time. The 10% where R is superior is data visualisation syntax \(nothing beats ggplot2\) and easy to use data manipulation \(thanks to Dyplr \). So again, using R is a pragmatic choice, R is often used by academics and people that have another job, full-time dev logically learns Python.
