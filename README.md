# Intro - R for SEO

_This guide, **in the course of writing**_, _is dedicated to all those who share their knowledge online and especially Hamlet Batista. I'm not a Python user like him and I just came across the guy once but his disappearance made us all remember that sharing is caring and that life is fucking short._

### 1.1 Motivation & Limite

Even though R'  is a terrific option for SEO, there are simply not enough resources out there. 

This guide is not here to deliver a course about R, there are plenty already. This guide is meant to be as practical as possible. How things should be done in an "R-ish way" is not the purpose of this guide. Grab what you want to grab and feel free to submit your own solution.

### 1.3 Project home

All documents, markdown files, scripts, and project images are also publicly available in [this repository](https://github.com/pixgarden/rforseo)

All errors are my own. All comments are welcome to improve this guide.
