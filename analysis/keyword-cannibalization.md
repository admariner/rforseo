# Hunt down keyword cannibalization

### What is keyword cannibalization?

if you put a lot of articles out there, at some point, some articles will compete with one another for the same keywords in Google result pages. it‚Äôs what SEO people call ‚Äòkeyword cannibalization‚Äô.

### Does it matter SEO-wise?

Sometimes it‚Äôs perfectly normal. I hope, for your sake, that several of your web pages show up when someone is typing your brand name in Google.

Sometimes it‚Äôs not. Let me give an example:

üí≠ Imagine you run an e-commerce website, with various page type: products, FAQ‚Äôs, blog posts, ‚Ä¶

At some point, Google decided to make a switch:  a couple of Google search queries that were sending traffic to product pages, now display a blog post of yours.

Inside Google Analytics, SEO sessions count is the same. Your ‚ÄòRank Tracking‚Äô software will not bring you up any position changes.

And yet, these blog post pages will be able to convert much less, and at the end of the month, this will result in a decrease in sales.

Sometimes it can't be fixed, the search intent is now different but sometimes it just because you neglected your product pages. Either way, it's good to know whats happening.

### How to check for keyword cannibalization?

There are several ways to do it. Of course, SEO tools people want you to use their tools, the [method from ahref](https://ahrefs.com/blog/keyword-cannibalization/) is definitely useful. Unfortunately, this kind of tool can be sometimes imprecise, it doesn‚Äôt take into account what‚Äôs really happening.

So let do it using R‚Äô. Once set up, you‚Äôll be able to check big batches of keywords in minutes. ü§ñ

### step 3 ‚Äì clean up

First, we‚Äôll filter out queries that are not on the 2 first SERPs and that doesn‚Äôt generate any click. There is no point of making useless time-consuming calculations.

We‚Äôll also remove branded search queries using a regex. As said earlier, having several positions for your brand name is pretty classic and shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a problem.

```r
gsc_queries_filtered <-gsc_all_queries %>%
    filter(position<=20) %>%
    filter(clicks!=0) %>%
    filter(!str_detect(query, 'brandname|brand name'))
```

_update this with your brand name_

### step 4 ‚Äì computations

We want to know for one query, what percentage of clicks are going to each landing page.

First, we‚Äôll create a new column **clicksT** with the aggregated number of clicks for each search query.  
Then, using this value to calculate what we need inside a new **per** column.

```r
gsc_queries_computed <- gsc_queries_filtered %>%
                                group_by(query) %>%
                                mutate(clicksT= sum(clicks)) %>%
                                group_by(page, add=TRUE) %>%
                                mutate(per=round(100*clicks/clicksT,2)) 

View(gsc_queries_computed)
```

A **per** column value of 100 means that all clicks go the same URL.

Last final steps, we will sort rows

```r
gsc_queries_final <- gsc_queries_computed %>%
                                arrange(desc(clicksT))
```

\[edit : \] It could also make sense fo remove rows where cannibalization is not significant. Where **per** column value is not very high. \[end of edit\]

Removing now useless columns: click, impression and total click per query group

```r
gsc_queries_final <-gsc_queries_final[,c(-3,-4,-7)]
```

Now it‚Äôs your choice to display it inside rstudio

```r
View(gsc_queries_final)
```

Or write a CSV file to open it elsewhere

```r
write.csv(gsc_queries_final,"./gsc_queries_final.csv")
```

Here is my rstudio view \(anonymized sorry üôä\)

### step 5 ‚Äì analysis

You should check data inside each ‚Äúquery pack‚Äù. Everything is sorted using the total number of clicks, so, first rows are critical, bottoms rows not so much.

To help you deal with this, let‚Äôs check the first one‚Äôs

![](https://www.gokam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/seqrch-query-1.jpg)

_**For Search query 1:**_  
97% of click are going to the same page. Their is no Keyword cannibalization here. It‚Äôs interesting to notice that the ‚Äòsecond‚Äô landing page, only earn 1,4% of clicks, even though, it got an average position of 1,5. Users really don‚Äôt like the second ‚ÄòLanging page‚Äô. Page metadata probably sucks.

Check if the first landing page is the right one and we should move on.

![](https://www.gokam.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/seqrch-query-2.jpg)

_**For Search query 2:**_  
63% of clicks are going to the first landing page. 36% to the second page. This is Keyword cannibalization.  
It could make sense to adapt internal linking between involved landing pages to influence which one should rank before the other one‚Äôs, depending on your goals, pages bounce rates, etc.

And so on‚Ä¶

This is it, my friends, I hope you‚Äôll find it be useful!
