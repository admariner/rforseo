# Using Esquisse to create a graph more quickly

ggplots is great package but it can be a bit overwhelming to deal with. So many options and functions. Lucky for us, thanks to Fanny Meyer & Victor Perrier, there is a shortcut, the [esquisse package](https://dreamrs.github.io/esquisse/index.html). It basically helps explore your data quickly and build a ggplot. 

Let me take an example  
  
As always installing and loading

```text
install.packages("esquisse")
library("esquisse")
```

After that, only one line of code to make the magic happens

```text
esquisser()
```

you picket your dataset, the field you want to import.
